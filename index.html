    Welcome to my portfolio page!!! My name is Marisa and I recently graduated from UCLA in June with a degree in Communication. 
    While I was at UCLA, I spent my time consuming ungodly amounts of boba, reading on the pillars of Royce Hall, and hanging out with my friends. 
    Fun fact, I was supposed to graduate in 2020, but took summer classes and extra classes some quarters to graduate a year early. 
    After graduation, I knew I wanted a job in the tech industry, but ultimately had trouble given I didn't have the skillset as many other people did. 
    I enrolled in UCLA Extension's Coding Bootcamp to bring myself to a level where I could be employer competitive as well as learn the extremely
    valuable skill that is coding! 

    I've always had a passion for photography and web design since high school when I was on yearbook staff. 
    And now with the skillset that I learned during my coding bootcamp, 
    I can finally pursue this passion and find a career in web design/devlopment. Please explore my page and feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
